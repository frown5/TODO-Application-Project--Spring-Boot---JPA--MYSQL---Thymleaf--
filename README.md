# TODO Application Project
 This is a simple Todo application that allows users to manage their tasks. Built with Spring Boot, Thymeleaf, and JPA (Java Persistence API), it provides a clean and functional user interface for creating, updating, and deleting tasks. Users can view their tasks, mark them as completed, and filter tasks based on their status.Technologies Used: Backend:  Spring Boot for rapid application development. Spring Data JPA for database interaction. Spring Web for RESTful API endpoints (optional for future extension). Spring Security (optional) for authentication and authorization. Frontend:  Thymeleaf for rendering HTML templates and binding dynamic content. Bootstrap or CSS (optional) for styling and creating a responsive design. Database:  H2 Database (in-memory database) for development purposes. MySQL/PostgreSQL for production (optional).
